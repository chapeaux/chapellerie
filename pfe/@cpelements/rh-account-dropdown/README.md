# Red Hat Account Dropdown Component

This is a companion component with pfe-navigation, it creates an account dropdown with appropriate content based on a user's roles and permissions.

## Usage

This component should be a direct child of `pfe-navigation`, and should have the attribute `slot="account"`

```html
<rh-account-dropdown slot="account"></rh-account-dropdown>
```

If it should be in logged out state:

- `login-link` should be set to a valid login URL

If it should be in a logged in state:

- `logout-link` should be set to a valid logout URL
- The component should be provided the information from the JWT via one of these methods:
  - Using the userData setter: Provide the JSON object from the JWT to the setter. Make a reference to the DOM object and set `.userData`, e.g.:
    ```js
    document.querySelector("rh-account-dropdown").userData =
      howeverYouGetTheJWT("make it so");
    ```
  - @todo via chapeaux and keycloack.js

> Tip: Don't add the `login-link` attribute until the auth state of the user is known, this will prevent a login link from flashing while the user's status is being figured out.

### UserData Object

The `userData` method expects an object that at minimum should have:

```json
{
  "realm_access": {
    "roles": []
  },
  "REDHAT_LOGIN": "wesruv@wakka-wakka.com",
  "lastName": "Ruvalcaba",
  "account_number": "123456",
  "preferred_username": "wesruv@wakka-wakka.com",
  "firstName": "Wes",
  "email": "wesruv@wakka-wakka.com",
  "username": "wesruv@wakka-wakka.com"
}
```

`realm_access.roles` is checked for two roles:

- `admin:org:all`
- `portal_manage_subscriptions`

If the user has these roles they should be present in the array, if not they can be left out.

## Attributes

### Author controlled attributes:

- `login-link`: Link to login user, required for anonymous users non-keycloack implementations will be put directly into an `<a>` tag.
- `logout-link`: Link to logout user, required for logged in users non-keycloack implementations will be put directly into an `<a>` tag.

### Component controlled attributes

- `avatar-url`: Provided by the component, used by `pfe-navigation`
- `full-name`: Provided by the component, used by `pfe-navigation`

## Events

- `pfe-shadow-dom-event`: Fires when an element is clicked inside of a dropdown in the shadow root. This is for analytics to properly categorize and report the event. `event.detail` has:
  - `target` Element clicked
  - `parent` the `pfe-navigation` element

## Dependencies

Is meant to be used inside of pfe-navigation as optional functionality.
